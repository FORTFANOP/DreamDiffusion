## Group - 1 PsychoPy Data Collection Submission

Software used to collect EEG data for the model

### Things to keep in mind before execution:
- Check and ensure the LSL code in the `Before Experiment`, `Begin Routine` and `End Routine` tabs of the `lsl_marker` code is correct
- Before final run, ensure time durations are optimal (currently 5 seconds per image)
- While running, in fullscreen mode, the mouse may not be visible.
  - Fix: In builder view, go to settings gear icon under the Experiment section, Screen tab, and check the Show Mouse button
- Also, currently the code only runs when I switch it from Pilot mode to Run mode (not sure what the diff is, but ensure it is in Run mode for the code to run)
